# Restrict Traefik public ports (80/443) to known sources on the public interface.
# All production traffic flows through Hetzner LB (private IP 10.0.0.2), which is
# accepted by the blanket private-network rule (10.0.0.0/16) in the firewall role.
# These public-interface rules are defense-in-depth for direct-to-node traffic.
# Empty list = allow from anywhere (default in firewall role).
